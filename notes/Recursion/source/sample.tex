	\chapter[]{Recursion}
	Recursion in this context is defined as a finite expression that implies
	succesion.
	\section{Recursive Equation}
	A recursive equation describes the value of the element of a succesion 
	parting from previous elements of that specific succesion. These can be defined
	in either a linear or non-linear way, depending on the problem to be solved by
	this recursive algorithm.
	\subsection{Homogeneous Linear Recursive Relation}
	A Homogeneous linear recursive relation is a relation that can be defined
	in mathematical terms as a relation that could be expressed by the formula:

	$$ \sum_{i = 0}^{k} a_i f(n-1) = 0 $$

	and that includes a characteristic polinomial that can be expressed as:
	$$\sum_{i = 0}^{k} a_i \lambda^(n-1)$$

	\subsection{Non-linear}
